This Android MVC Sample was posted by Joshua Musselwhite on his [Android Developer blog](http://www.therealjoshua.com/2011/11/android-architecture-part-1-intro/). Specifically, I got the code from the '[full sources here](http://www.therealjoshua.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/new-MVC.zip)' link on his '[Android Architecture: Part 10, The Activity Revisited](http://www.therealjoshua.com/2012/07/android-architecture-part-10-the-activity-revisited/)' page.

Joshua is a Los Angeles Freelance Developer. He has a bunch of great articles on his blog, I recommend reading it.

For the initial commit, I downloaded the code, installed it in Eclipse and ran it with no changes at all.
